tips for starting a blog

## make it readable
* please dont use white text on a black background. it's not pretty and horrible to read
* please dont use monospace fonts for longer sections of text that arent code/etc, especially dont use "blocky" monospace fonts
* use sensible spacing/margins/line height. dont let text span from left to right displayedge with no margin
* please look at your blog on a mobile phone at least once

## discoverability
* there are webrings, aggregator sites, blog search engines, etc etc
* have an rss feed, it should be full text

## misc
* i dont like [this terminal-inspired hugo theme](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal). yes it looks cool, but the readability is ass. im sorry, use a different fonts plsss
