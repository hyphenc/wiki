# corporate fails

* from oct to circa dec 2021: whatsapp android: voice msg button had to be tapped twice after first sending a normal text
* since late 2021: whatsapp android: in-app camera is glitchy and sometimes it doesnt 'keep' the photo
* since late 2021: spotify android: if you tap on the tabs on the bottom before the main interface is loaded (which takes too long) you have to restart the whole app for it to become responsive again
