this thought is still in progress

* i understand why people might not want to use http for their special little blog site or something, because one could argue that it discloses too much information (such as user agent, etc) or is bloated (?). or they just want a thing to experiment with which is totally fine
* but gemini feels a little unnecessary because why?? gopher is cool because it's old (even older than http), but gemini? feels out of place. also i dont like the forced tls (but there had to be something setting is apart from gemini ahaha)
* i just googled gemini and the first thing that comes up is a cryptocurrency exchange named gemini... because of course there's one :/
* a side effect of having a gopher/gemini site is that (probably) only tech-y people will ever visit. which can be a way to 'force' (wrong word maybe) a type of audience
* although it's cool that your blog is maybe gopher/gemini only, i still resent your site because in our http world it's such a hassle. even with browser extensions (which probably dont work on my phone). my rss reader doesnt know what gopher/gemini is, the links arent clickable. your blog is thus dead to me. i am sorry :/ it's a shame if your posts are otherwise good. but that's the price you pay if you restrict your audience like that i guess hmmmm
